### Prize Title
[comment]: # Title of the bounty. The bounty title should be short, catchy, and descriptive! Long, vague, and confusing titles will not catch the participants' attention and may result in lower projects submitted.

### Prize Bounty
[comment]: # List the token type (ETH/ERC-20) and amount.

### Challenge Description
[comment]: # Be as descriptive as possible about what you want to see built. Challenges should be useful for your organization, but open-ended enough to allow for creativity from hackers.

### Submission Requirements
[comment]: # What constitutes a valid submission to win the prize? A demo is strongly recommended (video/live dApp etc.). What will help you determine whether a submission passed a threshold of acceptable quality? Please include any relevant code contribution guidelines/standards, etc.

### Judging Criteria
[comment]: # How will the sponsor ultimately decide the winner/winners from all valid submissions?

### Winner Announcement Date
[comment]: # Please plan to have judges from your organization (or others you choose) review the submissions as early as possible after the hackathon ends (or immediately upon submission if you set your submission deadline up to be first-to-submit) to ensure prompt winner announcement and payout.

### Resources
[comment]: # Add links to documentation, demos, resources, etc. We highly recommend adding a link to your Discord or community groups where devs can get in touch with your team!
